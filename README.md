`-t path/to/tsconfig.json` or `--tsconfig path/to/tsconfig.json` 
Specifies the project to use the tool on. If no arguement given, the tool will use the tsconfig in the current working directory. 

`-e <number>` or  `--errorCode <number>`
Specifies the errors to fix. Several error codes can be specified during the same command. 
The easiest way to find error codes in your repository is to hover over the error in your IDE.

`-f <name>` or `--fixName <name>`
Specifies the types of codefixes to use. Several names can be specified. 

If both error numbers and fix names are given, then in order to be applied, a fix must be generated by a specified error and have a name that was specified.

`--write` 
Boolean for if the tool should overwrite previous code files with the codefixed code or emit any files with codefixed code. If `--write` not included, then the tool will print to console which files would have changed.

`--verbose`
Boolean for print to console diagnostics that happen during runtime. Set `--no-verbose` to turn these messages off.
